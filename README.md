# ESP8266_Example
Temerature Sensors and Buttons for ESP8266.

It is a part of my smart home setup.

The Flash Board is with extra Connector for Workbench power supply.
The Ground wire is connected to the ground from FTD1232.

The soldering timer works with MQTT and NodeRED. It also publish the temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 sensor to the MQTT Broker.
